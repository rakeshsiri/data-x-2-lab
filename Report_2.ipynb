With the aim to gather a well structured and clean dataset, we explored several datasets and finally selected the South Park Cartoon Dialogues dataset. South Park is a cartoon show. The dataset features 18 seasons of this show and has 70,000+ utterances or dialogues. This dataset is in the format that allows us to perform analyses or solve problems based on characters. The two problems that we are aiming to tackle using this dataset are:\n",

The model's performance is then evaluated based on how accurately it can predict the speaker of that particular dialogue. Here, the input is a quote or a dialogue and the output is one of the characters from the show.\n",

The statistical properties of n-grams can be exploited to generate probabilities for what the “next word” after a given set of words will be. This ability to give a probability for what the next word will be is the n-gram language model."
